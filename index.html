Below are links to current medical research in relation to efforts to contain and prevent viral transmission. If unfamiliar with reading information of this nature
While reading the entire article is encouraged, a review of the introduction (background/overview) at the start of each article and the conclusion at the end of the
article will provide an understanding of the findings of the researcher.  Note that some articles are 'systemic reviews'.  Articles of this type provide a summary
of the findings of multiple articles/research of the same investigatory focus.
